## Introduction

We develop a tool Displaced Decay Counter, **DDC**, for estimating the signal-event rates of different LLP models at various LHC far detectors. The input files can be LHEF, HepMC, or a CMND run card for Pythia8. It can be easily generalized to the cases of other collider types and detectors. One can also implement new detector's geometries in a straightforward manner into the code.




### Compilation

The code is written in C++. There is a Makefile. In the first line of Makefile, put in the path to your own Pythia8 and HepMC installation. Pythia8 should have been compiled with a link to zlib, in order to allow for reading *.lhe.gz files. If you do not use zlib, removev "-lz" in the line starting with "LDFLAGS". Run "make -jN" in the terminal to compile, where N is the number of CPU cores you want to use.


### Questions and bug reports
